# Basic Material UI app.

This project is a very simple app to explore building with Material UI. It does not include Redux, does not persist data, or include tests. It is NOT an example of best Practice, but a quick way of playing with some components.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## React context

React context is used to pass callbacks to child components. Again I realise this is not best practice.
